We'd like to be able to model interventions (both past and proposed) with the standard model. 
How would that work? Let's consider Gilkerson et al. (2017), in which 72 parents of typically developing children aged 9 to 21 months were assigned to immediate- or delayed-treatment (control) conditions. 
During treatment, parents were recorded 10 times over a 3-month period while engaging in a web-based intervention offering strategies for increasing talk and interaction. 
During a 9-month follow-up, parents completed additional recordings and language assessments. 
Overall, no differences were found in language behaviors between immediate-treatment versus delayed-treatment groups. 
However, parents who were at first below-average on automated language measures showed significant postintervention increases which held longitudinally, and children showed significant elevations in language ability.
Problem: Gilkerson 2017 only reports standardized scores (mean = 100 and SD = 15) for AWC (median split: bottom half M=84.09, upper half M=116.01), which are calculated from the original LENA norms (Gilkerson & Richards, 2008), where they report overall M=12,297 (SD=6462) per 12-hour session (so 1025 words/hour).

Let's use the hourly rates from individual children from Sperry et al. (2018), Hart & Risley (1995), Soderstrom & Wittebolle (2013), and Weisleder & Fernald (2013) to estimate the parameters of hourly input rate distributions for both child-directed speech (CDS) and all adult speech.

```

Based on data from `r nsubj_cds` children, the mean number of child-directed tokens heard per hour is `r round(cds_agg$mean,0)` (sd=`r round(cds_agg$sd,0)`).
Using data from `r nsubj_awc` children, the mean number of all adult tokens heard per hour is `r round(awc_agg$mean,0)` (sd=`r round(awc_agg$sd,0)`).
